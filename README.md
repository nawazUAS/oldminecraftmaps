# My Early Minecraft Creations

Explore the nostalgic worlds of my initial Minecraft endeavors, crafted with enthusiasm on my PS3 between 2014 and 2016. Back then, I was just a young kid, and it was my very first experience with Minecraft. These maps hold a special place in my heart (and on my GitHub-Account) because they capture the joy and creativity of my first steps into the fascinating world of Minecraft. Every placed block was a discovery, and each built structure reflected the imagination of a beginner. Join me on this journey and experience the humble beginnings of my Minecraft adventure.
