# My Early Minecraft Creations

Explore the nostalgic worlds of my initial Minecraft endeavors, crafted with enthusiasm on my PS3 between 2014 and 2016. Back then, I was just a young kid, and it was my very first experience with Minecraft. These maps hold a special place in my heart (and on my GitHub-Account) because they capture the joy and creativity of my first steps into the fascinating world of Minecraft. Every placed block was a discovery, and each built structure reflected the imagination of a beginner. Join me on this journey and experience the humble beginnings of my Minecraft adventure.
It includes:
- A Bedwars Map
- A Hungergames Map
- A Parkour Map
- A survival and a creative map
  
To enjoy these Minecraft maps, simply download and save them in the ../minecraft/saves folder on your PC or in the "Saved Data Utility (PS3â„¢)/USB Device" directory on your PlayStation 3. Ensure that the USB device is formatted in FAT32 for compatibility.
